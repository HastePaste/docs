## Suggestions
 * Add a better way to navigate back from the About and API pages to the main page where you paste stuff, the new paste button is really small.
 * Make the Save, Fork, Raw, New text selectable. (better UX)
 * Add some text styling to the About and API pages.
 * If you are viewing a saved paste, having a small title above the text would help.
 * If a paste is forked, have a "forked from <link>" to show it's not the original version just like GitHub does.
 * Add a tiny bit more info in the Info footer!
