## Suggestions

 * Add a few details about the website inside the repository as well. The details should atleast give a vague idea of the website being built, what it intends to do and what people are going to use it for.
 * Although the idea is great but the website looks a bit old fashioned. I understand that you have used the minimalistic approach to build it but atleast a few tweaks here and there would make it look great! Like all the details are bunched at the corner they could be at the top of the page like a `Navbar`: well organised and would give a great feel.
 * Add a better way to navigate back from the About and API pages to the main page where you paste stuff, the new paste button is really small.
 * Make the `Save`, `Fork`, `Raw`, `New` text selectable for a better UX.
 * Add some text styling to the About and API pages.
 * If you are viewing a saved paste, having a small title(like `SAVED`) above the text would help.
 * If a paste is forked, have a "forked from <link>" to show it's not the original version just like GitHub does.
 * Add a tiny bit more info in the Info footer!
 * Add tabs(with names that can be renamed according to user) so that a user can adjust his pasted text according to his needs and not go searching. 
 * Add markdown support.
 * Change the colour of the background or add themes.
 * The Matrix Movie colour theme would look great! The Matrix Code Green palette has 4 colors which are `Vampire Black` (#0D0208), `Dark Green` (#003B00), `Islamic Green` (#008F11) and `Malachite` (#00FF41).
 * Everytime someone opens the website, show a simple pop-up telling what the website does in a few lines and also have a check-box saying "Don't Show Again" which would help regular users from getting the pop-up.
 * Everytime when some-one open website show a simple pop-up telling what this website does in few lines and also have a check-box saying "Don't Show Again" which would help regular users from getting the pop-up.
 * Add area for comments about your website.
 * Make UI more responsive.
 * A navbar will be great and all the buttons on it looks good.
 * A dashboard for a user can be created where she/he/they can save his/her/their snippets.
 * Allow the viewer of a paste to apply syntax highlighting for various common languages. This could be a pulldown, including "none", applied without the paster having to specifiy a language at paste.
