## Suggestions

 * Add a few details about the site inside the repo as well. The details should atleast give a vague idea the website is going to be built. What it intends to do. What people are going to use it for.
 * Although the idea is great but the website looks a bit old fashioned. I understand that you have used the minimalistic approach to build it but atleast a few tweaks here and there would make it look great! Like all the details are bunched at the corner they could be at the top of the page like a navbar well organised, would give a great feel.
 * Add a better way to navigate back from the About and API pages to the main page where you paste stuff, the new paste button is really small.
 * Make the Save, Fork, Raw, New text selectable. (better UX)
 * Add some text styling to the About and API pages.
 * If you are viewing a saved paste, having a small title above the text would help.
 * If a paste is forked, have a "forked from <link>" to show it's not the original version just like GitHub does.
 * Add a tiny bit more info in the Info footer!
