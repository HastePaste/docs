## Suggestions
 * Add a few details about the site inside the repo as well. The details should atleast give a vague idea the website is going to be built. What it intends to do. What people are going to use it for.
 * Although the idea is great but the website looks a bit old fashioned. I understand that you have used the minimalistic approach to build it but atleast a few tweaks here and there would make it look great! Like all the details are bunched at the corner they could be at the top of the page like a navbar well organised, would give a great feel.
